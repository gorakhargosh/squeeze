'java/src/com/google/template/soy/examples'
This directory contains files related to using the examples from Java.
For the shared examples files, see top-level directory 'examples'.


1. Files for the simple example:

+ SimpleUsage.java
    Hand-written Java code that compiles simple.soy into a SoyTofu object and then uses the
    SoyTofu object to render the templates (printing them to System.out).


2. Files for the features example:

+ FeaturesUsage_globals.txt
    Compile-time globals file for the features examples.

+ FeaturesSoyInfo.java
    Generated Java file containing info parsed from features.soy. This file is generated by
    executing SoyParseInfoGenerator on features.soy.
    Note: For an example Ant target (and command line args) that generates this file, please
    see target 'parse-info-generation-example' within the top-level 'build.xml'.

+ FeaturesUsage.java
    Hand-written Java code that compiles simple.soy and features.soy into a SoyTofu object and then
    uses the SoyTofu object to render the templates (printing them to System.out).
