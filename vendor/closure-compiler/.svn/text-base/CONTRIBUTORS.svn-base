All contributors to Closure Compiler must sign a CLA.

What is a CLA?
----------------------------------------

A CLA (Contributor License Agreement) basically says that you own the
rights to any code you contribute, and that you give us permission to
use that code in Closure Compiler. You maintain the copyright on that
code.

Where do I sign up?
----------------------------------------

If you own all the rights to your code, you can fill out an individual CLA.

If your employer has any rights to your code, then they also need to fill
out a corporate CLA. If you don't know if your employer has any rights
to your code, you should ask before signing anything.
